## Custom reCAPTCHA

You can add Custom reCAPTCHA to your FormBold form. Unlike the Automatic reCAPTCHA, the Custom reCAPTCHA works with both AJAX and HTTP requests.

You can use your own reCAPTCHA keys and you don’t need to do any more additional verifications.

Follow these steps to add Custom reCAPTCHA to your Form:



1. Go to the Form Setting.

After you turn it on you’ll have to provide your custom site key and private key.

Let’s go ahead and generate the keys.


3. To get the keys go to Google reCAPTCHA. After that go to v3 Admin Console

6. Now you’ll have to add the reCAPTCHA div. You’ll have to add it before the submit button and load the recaptcha API file to make it work properly.



Like this: 

```html
<script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js" async defer></script>

<form
  action="https://formbold.com/s/Form_ID"
  method="POST"
>
  <label>
    Your email:
    <input type="email" name="email">
  </label>
  <label>
    Your message:
    <textarea name="message"></textarea>
  </label>

  <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="your recaptcha site key"></div>

  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```
