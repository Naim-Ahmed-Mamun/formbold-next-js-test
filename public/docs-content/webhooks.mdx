# Webhooks Guide

FormBold Offers Webhooks, you can use it to get all the submissions as JSON. You can use them and analyze them as you want.

To be able to use the API first you’ll have to turn on the HTTP API access. 

After that, you’ll have to generate the Token.



## Generate Token



1. Go to the Webhooks tab. You’ll see a lot of options there.

2. After that generate the Token.

To generate a token add a name and click on the Create button.

When you click on the button it’ll generate a token for you. You can copy it by clicking the copy button

If you want to delete the token then click on the Delete icon. It’ll remove the token, you won’t be able to access the API with that token anymore.





## Get All the Submissions

To send the request you need the Token and the API endpoint.

We’ve generated the token above. Now we need the endpoint.


**Here’s the base URL:**

```bash copy
https://api.formbold.com
```



**Authorization:**
Before sending the request we will have to attach the Auth Token to the Request Header. It’s the token we generated earlier.

Add that as a bearer token like this to the Request Header:



```bash copy
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```



After that, you’ll have to send a request to the API. Here we are going to get all the submissions.

For that, we will hit this endpoint:

```bash copy
GET /api/forms/formId/submissions?page=1&limit=2
```



To fetch all the submissions at once hit this endpoint:



```bash copy
GET /api/forms/formId/submissions?all=true
```



If the request is completed successfully you’ll receive a JSON response like this.



```json copy
{
    "data": [
        {
            "created_at": "2022-06-14T04:41:39.000000Z",
            "fields": {
                "email": "elon@tesla.com",
                "message": "Test message"
            },
            "files": [],
            "is_spam": false
        },
        {
            "created_at": "2022-06-14T04:46:45.000000Z",
            "fields": {
                "email": "tim@apple.com",
                "message": "123"
            },
            "files": [],
            "is_spam": false
        },
        {
            "created_at": "2022-06-14T04:48:46.000000Z",
            "fields": {
                "email": "mark@protonmail.com",
                "message": "Example text"
            },
            "files": [],
            "is_spam": false
        }
    ],
    "meta": {
        "pagination": {
            "count": 3,
            "current_page": 1,
            "links": {},
            "per_page": 25,
            "total": 3,
            "total_pages": 1
        }
