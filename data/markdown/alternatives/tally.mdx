## Tally Overview
Tally is an advanced no-code form builder designed for marketers, creators, and enterprise teams. It offers a powerful form editor with logic, calculations, file uploads, payment collection, and integrations—all on a generous free plan.

However, key features like branding removal, custom domains, CSS customization, and advanced analytics are locked behind a $24/month Pro plan.

While Tally excels at design flexibility, it’s not API-first and may be overkill for developers needing a lightweight backend.

## Why Choose FormBold Over Tally?
FormBold offers a **faster, cleaner** form backend built for developers, startups, and growing businesses that need simplicity, control, and deep integration without the overhead.

### Why FormBold is a Better Fit for Many Use Cases:
- Built for Developers with HTML forms, Form API, webhooks, and real-time data
- Affordable Pricing starting at $4/month
- Dashboard Included to view, filter, and export submissions
- Free Integrations with Slack, Discord, Telegram, Notion, and Google Sheets
- No-code Friendly for static sites, Webflow, and React apps
- Spam Protection with reCAPTCHA, domain lock, and redirect control
- No Branding even on the free plan


## Final Verdict - Tally or FormBold?
If you need advanced form design and team collaboration, Tally works—but it’s costly. FormBold is better for clean, backend-first forms, works anywhere, removes branding for free, and offers powerful integrations at a lower price.

## FAQ Section
