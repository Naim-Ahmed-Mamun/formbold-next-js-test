## What is Web3Forms?
Web3Forms is a no-signup, plug-and-play form backend solution aimed at static site developers. It works with plain HTML forms and offers basic spam protection, unlimited forms, and 250 submissions per month on its free plan.

The Pro plan expands features like file uploads, spam filtering, and third-party integrations such as Slack, Notion, and Google Sheets. However, it lacks an integrated dashboard for managing form entries and requires users to rely on email notifications or connected services for data access.

## Why Choose FormBold Over Web3Forms?

FormBold offers a more powerful and scalable form backend solution with deeper integration support, a better user interface, and more generous free-tier capabilities.

### What Sets FormBold Apart:
- Built-in Dashboard to view, filter, and export submissions
- Free Plan includes integrations, autoresponders, CSV export, and webhooks
- Developer Tools like real-time analytics, redirects, and JSON API
- Native Integrations with Slack, Discord, Telegram, Notion, and Google Sheets
- No Branding even on the free plan
- Starts at $4/month with flexible upgrade options
- Works with Automation Tools for smooth workflows
- Spam Protection with filters, domain lock, and reCAPTCHA

## Final Verdict — Web3Forms or FormBold?
Web3Forms is ideal for quick forms on static sites where simplicity matters most. But if you need more control, automation, analytics, or multiple integration options without paying extra, **FormBold wins on both value and versatility.**

With robust features across free and paid plans, seamless integrations, and a full-fledged dashboard, FormBold is a more complete solution for developers, freelancers, and teams.
