## Formspark Overview
Formspark offers a unique model: a one-time payment ($25 or $50) for 50,000 form submissions. Ideal if you want a "set it and forget it" solution—but its minimalist approach means many common features are missing:

- No autoresponders
- No form builder or UI tools
- No integrations
- No branding control
- No custom domain support

It’s a basic backend for basic use cases—but limited for scale or real business workflows.
