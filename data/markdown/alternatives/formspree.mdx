## Formspree Overview

Formspree is a classic form backend-as-a-service, ideal for static sites and developers. It offers a **free plan with 50 submissions**, but most practical features—like autoresponders, spam protection, API access, and custom redirects—are locked behind its **$10 to $60/month** paid plans.

While Formspree is reliable, its tiered pricing model locks essential features behind steep paywalls, making scaling expensive for indie developers and small teams.

## Why Choose FormBold Over Formspree?

FormBold is designed for **modern developers, startups, and makers** who want more control, freedom, and value—without paying a premium for basics.

- More Free Submissions with 100/month vs 50 on Formspree
- Autoresponders and Webhooks included on the free plan
- API-First Approach with full JSON access for developers
- Affordable Pro Plan starting at just $4/month
- Free Integrations like Slack, Notion, Google Sheets, and more
- Built-in Features like custom redirects, spam protection, and CSV export
- No Team Plan Lock-in — use solo without forced upgrades
