## Hugo Contact Form with Backend API

Create fully functional contact forms in your Hugo site without writing server-side code. With FormBold, you only need to paste your unique API endpoint into the form’s action attribute—setup is quick and backend-free.

```html
<form
	action="https://formbold.com/s/YOUR-FORM-ID"
	method="POST"
	style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; max-width: 400px; gap: 1rem;"
  >
	<label>
	  Name:
	  <input type="text" name="name" required style="width: 100%; padding: 8px;" />
	</label>

	<label>
	  Email:
	  <input type="email" name="email" required style="width: 100%; padding: 8px;" />
	</label>

	<label>
	  Message:
	  <textarea name="message" rows="5" required style="width: 100%; padding: 8px;"></textarea>
	</label>

	<button type="submit" style="padding: 10px 20px; cursor: pointer;">
	  Send Message
