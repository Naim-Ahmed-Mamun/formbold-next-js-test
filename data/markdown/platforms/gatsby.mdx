## Gatsby Contact Form with Backend API

Add a fully functional contact form to your Gatsby site without writing backend code. With FormBold, simply paste your unique API endpoint into the form action attribute, and you're all set to start collecting submissions.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Form() {
  const [responseMessage, setResponseMessage] = useState("");

  async function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(event.target);

    const object = Object.fromEntries(formData);
    const json = JSON.stringify(object);

    const response = await fetch("https://formbold.com/s/unique_form_id", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Accept: "application/json",
      },
      body: json,
    });
    const result = await response.json();

    if (response.ok) {
      setResponseMessage(result.message);
      event.target.reset();
    }
    setResponseMessage(result.message || "Something went wrong");
    setTimeout(() => setResponseMessage(""), 3000);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <div className="container">
        <div className="form-wrapper">
          <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <div>
              <input
                type="email"
                name="email"
                id="email"
                placeholder="Your Email"
                required
              />
            </div>

            <div>
              <input

            </div>

            <div>
