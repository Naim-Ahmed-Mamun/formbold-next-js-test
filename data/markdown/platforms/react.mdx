Create powerful contact forms in your React projects without writing any backend code. With FormBold, you can set up a fully functional React contact form in minutes. Just use the provided API endpoint in your form handler and start capturing submissions with minimal setup.

export default function Form() {
  const [responseMessage, setResponseMessage] = useState("");

  async function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(event.target);

    const object = Object.fromEntries(formData);
    const json = JSON.stringify(object);

    const response = await fetch("https://formbold.com/s/unique_form_id", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Accept: "application/json",
      },
      body: json,
    });
    const result = await response.json();

    if (response.ok) {
      setResponseMessage(result.message);
      event.target.reset();
    }
    setResponseMessage(result.message || "Something went wrong");
    setTimeout(() => setResponseMessage(""), 3000);
  }
