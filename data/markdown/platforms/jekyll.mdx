Create powerful contact forms in your Jekyll site without writing any server-side code. With FormBold, you just need to paste your unique API endpoint into your form’s action attribute—and you're all set.

```html
<div class="contact-page">

  <form
    action="https://formbold.com/s/YOUR-FORM-ID"
    method="POST"
    style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; max-width: 400px; gap: 1rem;"
  >
    <label>
      Name:
      <input type="text" name="name" required style="width: 100%; padding: 8px;" />
