description: How to use form upload and attachment support on FormBold
---

Here is how you can use form upload features, FYI form upload is only available for starter and business users. All you need to add an **upload field** on the form just like another text field and add **enctype="multipart/form-data"** inside the form tag.
For now, FormBold supports 5MB maximum upload (each file) with 30 days of data retention.
