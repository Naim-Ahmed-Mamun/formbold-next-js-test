## Create an API token

In order to work with API, you have to use a key. You can make it on the [“API Tokens”](https://app.formbold.com/user/api-tokens) page.

## Authorizing the requests

Once you have the API token created, you can use it to authenticate your requests by putting it in “**Bearer authentication**”, such as following:

```http
Authorization: Bearer yourKey
```

## Submissions list

```http
GET /api/forms/formId/submissions?page=1
```

Example response:
